#
#   If a location is defined by a prefix string that ends with the
#   slash character, and requests are processed by one of proxy_pass,
#   fastcgi_pass, uwsgi_pass, scgi_pass, memcached_pass, or grpc_pass,
#   then the special processing is performed. In response to a request
#   with URI equal to this string, but without the trailing slash, a
#   permanent redirect with the code 301 will be returned to the
#   requested URI with the slash appended. If this is not desired, an
#   exact match of the URI and location could be defined like this:
#
#   location /user/ {
#       proxy_pass http://user.example.com;
#    }
#
#   location = /user {
#       proxy_pass http://login.example.com;
#   }
